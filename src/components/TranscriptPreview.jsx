Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing bracket for the `getDisplayedCreditSummary` function
2. Missing closing bracket for the `TranscriptPreview` component
3. Missing closing bracket for the `return` statement

Here are the added closing brackets at the end of the file:

```javascript
    </div>
  )
}

export default TranscriptPreview
```

The file is now properly closed with all required brackets. The component structure is complete and should compile without syntax errors.
